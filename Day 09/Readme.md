ðŸ“… **Date:** July 16, 2025

## ðŸ“š Topics Practiced:
### ðŸ”¹ Functions
- Built reusable functions for tasks like directory backup
- Handled arguments passed to functions

### ðŸ”¹ Script Enhancements
- Conditionals: `if`, `else`
- Arithmetic: `expr`, `$(( ))`, `bc`
- `read` command for user input
- `case` statements for multi-choice handling
- `for` loops for iteration

### ðŸ”¹ Real-world Example
- Automated backups via a function that compresses folders with timestamps
- CLI menus built with `case` for better user interactions

All commands and examples consolidated in:
[`day09_linux_practice.sh`](./day09_linux_practice.sh)
