# Day 3 â€“ Linux Practice: File Handling, Viewing, and Resource Monitoring
ðŸ“… **Date:** July 10, 2025

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered (New):
- `ls` command variations for listing and sorting files
- `top` for process and memory monitoring
- Viewing and navigating large files with `cat`, `less`, `more`, `head`, `tail`, `view`
- File metadata and type inspection with `file`
- Redirection and piping: `>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`
- Creating, writing to, and deleting files/directories

## ðŸ”§ Hands-On Practice:
- Practiced over 25 `ls` options for real-world file inspections
- Used `top` with memory/user filters
- Read and filtered files with piping and `grep`
- Created scripts to log outputs and redirect results
- Practiced creating/deleting deep directories and batches of files

ðŸ‘‰ All commands are saved in [`day3_practice.sh`](./day3_practice.sh)

## ðŸ’¬ Reflections:
- Using `less`, `head`, and `tail` makes parsing long logs so much easier
- `top` is extremely useful for real-time system health monitoring
- File redirection and pipes are game-changing when chained together
- Practicing older topics again helped reinforce confidence

## ðŸ§  Previous Topics Practiced:
- Revisited: file permissions, ownership, `chmod`
